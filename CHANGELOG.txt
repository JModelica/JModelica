================= Unreleased ==================
# Change ; Minor ; Compiler ; #5815
FilterableIterator now adheres to the contract of Iterator and properly supports "null" elements in the parent iterator.

Note that while java.nio allows to access non-File resources with the same API, the internal workings of JModelica
currently make restrictions on only supporting file accesses.
